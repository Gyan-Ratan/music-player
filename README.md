# music-player
I just want to create my own music player written in python. I chosed to use kivy as development framework to build the GUI and to properly handle the audio

## Current Requirements
- Playing music
- creating, modifying and reproducing playlists

## TODO
- ASAP: replace kivy SoundLoader class with pure GStreamer in order to have a player indipendent from the GUI used.

## Dependencies
- GStreamer v0.1
- Kivy library installed for python 2. Instructions: https://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-linux.html#ubuntu-11-10-or-newer
